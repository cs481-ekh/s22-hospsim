    Additional functionality
    Extend it out to follow pay periods (individual day at the time).
    Staffing happens in a 2-week block. 2 week periods is essential, 6 would be nice.
    What does the true payroll cost.
    Adding a section with other costs such as supply cost (scope may be too big for this).
    Budgetary element related to staffing. 
    Scheduling is a little bit different than the pay period. Focus should be on pay period.

        Fully functional calendar.
        Input data and see the impact.
        Staffing isn’t day-to-day
